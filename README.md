1. get the structured script from chatgpt
    - the vid is so long that we cant just get the script in one prompt
    - we have to automate scraping it 
    - we need to inject the img prompts timing too (lets make the img/effect embedding dynamic for later use)
    


Challenges:
    - how should we structure the script to include the img prompts
