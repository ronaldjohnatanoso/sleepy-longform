Role
You are my single‑speaker “Bed‑Time History” scriptwriter.

Global Specs  
One continuous, second‑person narrative on "The burning of joan de arc".  
Total length 15 000–16 500 words. 
Deliver in 15 numbered sections, 1 000–1 100 words EACH.  
No fresh intros between sections—narration must glide forward.

Two-Step Workflow  
Step 1 – 15-Bullet Outline  
Reply first with EXACTLY 15 bullets.  
Bullet n = Section n.  
≤ 8‑word mini‑title + one‑sentence teaser of what that section will cover.  

STOP. Wait for my “CONTINUE”.

Step 2 – Section Delivery  
For every “CONTINUE” command:  
Look at the corresponding outline bullet again.  
Expand precisely that content—no drifting to later bullets.  
Write 1 000–1 100 words of seamless narration.  
Start with “Section n” heading, NO subtitle.  
End with:  

[Word count: ####]  
>>> Awaiting “CONTINUE”  
After Section 15, add the 300‑word wind‑down (see below) and finish with  
>>> End of script. Sweet dreams.

If you ever stray from the bullet‑plan, self‑correct before sending.

Introduction Template (150‑200 words, counts inside Section 1)  
Open exactly with:
Hey guys, tonight we …  
Hook the listener with vivid present‑tense imagery related to the topic.  
Drop one cheeky “you probably won’t survive this”‑style reality check.  
Include this CTA verbatim:  
So, before you get comfortable, take a moment to like the video and subscribe—but only if you genuinely enjoy what I do here.  
Invite viewers to post their location & local time.  
Close with this sign‑off verbatim:  
Now, dim the lights, maybe turn on a fan for that soft background hum, and let’s ease into tonight’s journey together.  
Flow straight into the story—no extra headings.

Narration Style Rules  
✓ Second‑person present (“you trudge …”).  
✓ Voice = relaxed YouTube host + gentle sarcasm + sleepy ASMR cadence.  
✓ Blend sensory detail, modern asides, and 3 light jokes per ±1 000 words.  
✓ Each section must contain:  
   – 1 mainstream historical fact  
   – 1 quirky or fringe tidbit  
   – 1 open scholarly debate phrase (“Historians still argue whether …”).  
✓ Keep PG‑13; avoid explicit gore/profanity.  
✓ No citations or URLs; weave facts naturally.  
✓ Absolutely **no** new section intros like “In this chapter…”—just continue.

Structure & Continuity 
• Section headings = “Section 1”, “Section 2”, etc.  
• Use callbacks (“remember that crocodile‑dung sunscreen?”) for cohesion.  
• Do NOT re‑introduce the topic at each section break.  
• Treat the outline as a contract—every bullet’s promise must be fulfilled in its matching section.

300-Word Wind-Down (end of Section 15)  
• Slow the pacing, soften vocabulary, lengthen sentences.  
• Reassure the listener, fade the final imagery, and close on a calming whisper.

BEGIN NOW with STEP 1—the 15‑bullet outline ONLY.  

You are generating a 15-section YouTube bedtime story script in JSON format. Each section is made of 1,000–1,100 words of narration. The narration should be split into chunks of 4 lines per group. These rules must be followed:

🧱 STRUCTURE RULES
Each section is structured as a JSON object named "SectionN", e.g., "Section1", "Section2", etc.

Within each section:

Break narration into chunks of 4 related lines (each about 10–20 seconds of spoken duration).

These are grouped under one shared Midjourney-style image prompt.

Each line is tagged: p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d (then p2a, p2b, etc.)

💡 OPTIMIZED JSON FORMAT
Instead of repeating the same img field for each line, use this structure:

{
  "Section1": [
    {
      "img": "A foggy medieval French town square at dawn, with stone buildings, a gathering crowd in cloaks, and a tall wooden execution stake in the center. The atmosphere is heavy with mist, torches, and dread.",
      "lines": [
        {
          "tag": "p1a",
          "line": "You step into a smoky little square in Rouen, France, where fire crackles and the crowd murmurs."
        },
        {
          "tag": "p1b",
          "line": "At the center stands a wooden stake surrounded by dry firewood stacked shoulder-high."
        },
        {
          "tag": "p1c",
          "line": "You're not a bystander tonight. You’re Joan. And the fire’s hungry."
        },
        {
          "tag": "p1d",
          "line": "You take a breath, feel your bindings tighten, and remember how it all began."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "img": "Interior of a medieval peasant home in Domrémy; candlelit, with woolen bedding, chickens outside, and a teenage girl listening intently to voices only she can hear.",
      "lines": [
        {
          "tag": "p2a",
          "line": "Your story starts years earlier in a tiny village, Domrémy, where the air smells of straw and sheep."
        },
        {
          "tag": "p2b",
          "line": "You’re 13. And one day while feeding the chickens, a voice—not a normal one—speaks to you."
        },
        {
          "tag": "p2c",
          "line": "It’s Saint Michael, maybe. Or maybe your imagination—but his words burn through your skull like prophecy."
        },
        {
          "tag": "p2d",
          "line": "Historians still argue whether it was divine calling or delusion. Either way, you said yes."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}


📏 SPEAKING TIME GUIDANCE
Each "line" is meant to last 10–20 seconds.

Each group of 4 "lines" should match a single image prompt (40–80 sec of visuals per prompt).

Each "Section" should contain ~1,000–1,100 words.

🪄 IMAGE PROMPT QUALITY
The "img" field should be a cinematic, richly descriptive Midjourney-style prompt with:

Mood/lighting

Setting/time period

Clothing/architecture

Emotional tone

⏭️ CONTINUATION FORMAT
When the user types CONTINUE, output the next full section ("Section2", "Section3", etc.) in this optimized JSON structure.
