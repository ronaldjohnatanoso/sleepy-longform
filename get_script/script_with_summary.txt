🎭 ROLE  
You are my single-speaker YouTube scriptwriter in the style of *Bedtime History* meets *ASMR documentary*.  
Topic: The Burning of Joan of Arc  
Your goal: A 15,000–16,500 word, second-person bedtime story broken into 15 sections of ~1,000–1,100 words each.  

🧱 GLOBAL STRUCTURE  
- 15 total sections  
- Each section is titled "Section1", "Section2", ..., "Section15" in JSON  
- Each section contains:  
  • Narration grouped into chunks of 4 lines  
  • Each chunk shares a single "img" Midjourney-style image prompt  
  • Each line is labeled with a "tag": s1p1a, s1p1b, s1p1c, s1p1d, s1p2a, etc. (prefix includes section number)  
- Every 4-line group = ~40–80 seconds of voiceover  

✨ OUTPUT FORMAT (Step 2)  

Example JSON structure (used after “CONTINUE”):  

{
  "Section1": [
    {
      "img": "A foggy medieval French town square at dawn, with stone buildings, a gathering crowd in cloaks, and a tall wooden execution stake in the center. The atmosphere is heavy with mist, torches, and dread.",
      "lines": [
        { "tag": "s1p1a", "line": "You step into a smoky little square in Rouen, France, where fire crackles and the crowd murmurs." },
        { "tag": "s1p1b", "line": "At the center stands a wooden stake surrounded by dry firewood stacked shoulder-high." },
        { "tag": "s1p1c", "line": "You're not a bystander tonight. You’re Joan. And the fire’s hungry." },
        { "tag": "s1p1d", "line": "You take a breath, feel your bindings tighten, and remember how it all began." }
      ]
    },
    {
      "img": "Interior of a medieval peasant home in Domrémy; candlelit, with woolen bedding, chickens outside, and a teenage girl listening intently to voices only she can hear.",
      "lines": [
        { "tag": "s1p2a", "line": "Your story starts years earlier in a tiny village, Domrémy, where the air smells of straw and sheep." },
        { "tag": "s1p2b", "line": "You’re 13. And one day while feeding the chickens, a voice—not a normal one—speaks to you." },
        { "tag": "s1p2c", "line": "It’s Saint Michael, maybe. Or maybe your imagination—but his words burn through your skull like prophecy." },
        { "tag": "s1p2d", "line": "Historians still argue whether it was divine calling or delusion. Either way, you said yes." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

🎬 INTRO RULES  

The first 4 lines of Section1 must follow this verbatim structure and tone:  

Hey guys, tonight we’re headed back to a smoky little square in Rouen, France—where the crowd smells like unwashed wool, the air is thick with tension, and something terrifying crackles just out of view.  

You stand near a tall wooden stake, smoke licking at your ankles, and you’re not a bystander—you’re the main event. Firewood stacks taller than your head, and let’s be real: you probably won’t survive this.  

So, before you get comfortable, take a moment to like the video and subscribe—but only if you genuinely enjoy what I do here. Also, drop your location and local time in the comments—I love seeing where everyone’s watching from.  

Now, dim the lights, maybe turn on a fan for that soft background hum, and let’s ease into tonight’s journey together. Smoke curls. Boots crunch in gravel. You take a deep breath—and begin to remember.  

(This counts toward Section1’s word total.)

🎤 NARRATION STYLE  

✓ Second-person present tense ("You walk...")  
✓ Mix sleepy narration with sly humor and immersive sensory detail  
✓ Each section must include:  
  – 1 historical fact  
  – 1 quirky or fringe detail  
  – 1 open scholarly debate ("Historians still argue whether…")  
✓ PG-13 only — no gore or profanity  
✓ Weave facts naturally — no formal sourcing or citations  
✓ Light jokes, callbacks, and modern references welcome  
✓ No intros between sections — narration must glide forward
