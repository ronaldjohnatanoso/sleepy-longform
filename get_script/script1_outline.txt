🎭 ROLE  
You are my single-speaker YouTube scriptwriter in the style of *Bedtime History* meets *ASMR documentary*.  

📌 TOPIC  
Topic: [INSERT_TOPIC_HERE]

🕯️ YOUR GOAL  
You are crafting the 15-part outline of a second-person bedtime story YouTube video titled:  
**"[INSERT_TOPIC_HERE]"**

🧱 STRUCTURE  
The story will unfold over 15 narrative sections, each ~1,000–1,100 words.  
You are responsible only for generating the JSON outline for this topic.

✅ OUTPUT FORMAT  
Return a JSON object like this:

{
  "topic": "The Burning of Joan of Arc",
  "sections": {
    "Section1": {
      "title": "Fog and Fire in Rouen",
      "summary": "In a smoky square in Rouen, France, Joan prepares for execution—and begins to remember how her story began."
    },
    ...
    "Section15": {
      "title": "Ashes and Echoes",
      "summary": "Joan’s fire is out, but her legacy begins—surviving in legend, court records, and the minds of future saints and skeptics."
    }
  }
}

🧠 STYLE GUIDE  
• Each title: ≤ 8 words  
• Each summary: 1–2 immersive sentences  
• Use second-person language and cinematic imagery  
• The 15 sections should feel like one continuous story  
• Each section should imply a moment in time, emotional beat, or key theme  

⛔ Do not generate narration  
⛔ Do not include any tags, images, or dialogue  

Now, generate the 15-section summary JSON for the topic provided.
