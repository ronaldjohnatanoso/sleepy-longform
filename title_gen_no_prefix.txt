Role & Goal  
Act as an experienced YouTube content strategist. Your sole task is to brainstorm fresh, clickable video-topic ideas that match this style: slow-paced, gently humorous historical storytelling designed to help viewers relax or fall asleep.  

Output  
Provide 10 unique video titles in a numbered list.  
Each title must contain a concise, curiosity-driven hook (≤ 14 words) teasing an obscure fact, vivid scenario, or surprising question.  
When relevant, append runtime tags exactly as the audience expects, e.g. “(2 HOURS)”, “(4 HOURS)”, or “Gentle Storytelling & Ambient Sounds (2 HOURS)”.  

Do *not* include any of the following prefixes in the title:  
“Boring History For Sleep | ”  
“The Boring History For Sleep | ”  
“Boring Greek Myths For Sleep | ”  
“History Podcast For Sleep | ”  

Content Criteria  
• Variety – Cover multiple eras (Ancient, Medieval, Early-Modern, 19–20th cent.), regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, Americas, Oceania), and themes (medicine, food, daily routines, punishments, gender roles, famous biographies, odd laws, forgotten inventions, lost cities, mythical creatures, etc.).  
• Tone – Titles should sound mildly tongue-in-cheek but not sensational; they must promise oddly soothing facts, gentle humor, and immersive “you-are-there” detail—never modern moral outrage or click-bait shock.  
• Inclusivity & Freshness – At least one-third of the list should highlight lesser-known cultures or under-represented figures.  
• Sleep-Friendly – Avoid harsh words in the title (“horrific torture” → “peculiar punishments”).  
• Keyword Logic – Work one or two SEO-friendly nouns into each title (“silk routes,” “Aztec gardens,” “Victorian insomnia cures”) while keeping the phrasing natural.

something like napoleon, or vikings, or some other shit
